# 🚀 File Transfer Application

A modern, secure, and user-friendly file transfer application built as the **final project** for my **Celebal Tech React.js Internship Assignment**. This application leverages **Socket.IO** for real-time file sharing, robust authentication, and a responsive design to provide seamless file transfers across devices.

## 🚦 How It Works

1. **Sign Up / Sign In:**  
   Users register or log in to gain secure access to the file transfer features.

2. **Select File & Recipient:**  
   Choose a file from your device and select the recipient user.

3. **Initiate Transfer:**  
   The app establishes a secure, real-time Socket.IO connection between sender and recipient.

4. **Progress Tracking:**  
   Both users see real-time progress indicators and status updates during the transfer.

5. **Transfer Completion:**  
   The recipient can download the file once the transfer is complete.

## 🔒 Security

- **End-to-End Encryption:** All file data is encrypted during transfer.
